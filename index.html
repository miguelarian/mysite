                My name is Miguel Vela Romera. I studied computer science at University of Alicante (Spain) and I currently work as software developer at the United Kingdom.
                I am an experienced developer and I strongly enjoy programming and discovering new technologies.
                I never stop learning about software and hardware. In my free time I use to travel to different countries and practise sports.
            </p>
            <p>
                I work for <a target="_blank" href="http://volumeglobal.com">Volume Ltd.</a> My role as part of the innovation team in UK is to develop web advertising projects and platforms by using Microsoft ASP .Net, C#, SQL Server, HTML5, JQuery and other Javascript frameworks. I work together with a team of creative and user experience developers to successfully meet the client expectations and guarantee the best quality of the products.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am a very perseverant, committed and hard working individual. I feel passion about mobile/web development, new technologies and the Internet of the Things.
                With a strict attention to detail, IÂ´m strongly organized and disciplined to meet my own goals and overcome with patience any unexpected problem.
            </p>

                Since I was a child, I have been passionate about computing and robotics.
                I was one year old when I first sat in front of a PC and since then my curiosity and interest in computers have only continue to grow.
                I love videogames and technology, and my degree has given me the opportunity to develop applications and create my own solution for an increasing modern society problem.
                I strongly believe that applying technology to everyday problems, innovate and make the best use of the latest developments are the principles to create a better world.
